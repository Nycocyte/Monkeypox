Monkeypox's global spread highlights the urgency of early detection to prevent potential pandemics.
Transfer Learning (TL) enhances the performance of six Deep Learning (DL) models, including VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG1
Modified VGG19 and MobileNetV2 models exhibit outstanding accuracy
These findings are DL-based early disease detection's potential in combating emerging health crucial for disease prevention, particularly in resource-limited areas, emphasizing  threats.
